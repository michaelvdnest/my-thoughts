# House Tregesser


Simon, Valerena and Blessed Tregesser - the ruling family of a Tregesser House

- But now the [[House Tregesser]] believes they have an edge; a force from outside [[Canon Space]] offers them the resources to throw off [[Guardship]] rule. 

One of the galaxy Houses wants to capture a Guardship for their own ends. They ally themselves with the [[Outsiders]], a vast empire of methane breather aliens who wants to enter the system/galaxy protected by the Guardships. Oh yes, the [[Guardships]]' crew are only humans.

So you have the three top [[House]] leaders, the leader, his daughter and her son conspiring not only against the Guardships but against themselves.

When one of the mightiest [[Houses]] decides to execute plan hundreds of years in making to control the Canon [by conspiring with aliens and mysterious non-Canon-space forces] Guardships get automatically activated and what starts as dangerous xenos planet-wide hunt soon escalates into years long conflict that will bring the Canon space to the very brink of extinction.
