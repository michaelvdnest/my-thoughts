# Lupo Provik

Simon's right-hand man and security advisor of the House

- Unfortunately for Simon, he lives in a universe where not only do plans not survive their first encounter with the enemy, they don’t even survive encounters with allies or in some cases with the plan’s architect. Simon’s daughter and grandson both have their own agendas (as do their many clones). Tregressor is making common cause with chaotic evil aliens, who may be enemies of the Guardships … but aren’t pro-Simon. Even Simon’s trusted right hand man, the extremely scary [[Lupo Provik]], isn’t 100% on board with the old man’s scheme. 

[[Lupo Provik]] works for them and is the brains behind the traps and plans against the Guardships. He also has replication technology like the Guardships and clones himself. He has a girlfriend that is actually a female clone of himself. That's right. The book never states that, it took me awhile to realize Two ([[Lupo Two]], a clone) was a female and while on Lupo's POV they're all business and plans, when the POV switches to other characters and they mention "Lupo and his girlfriend" and it was only after many times that I realized they were actually talking about Lupo Two.
