# Starbase

- There is even an impregnable [[starbase]], where every shipsâ€™ information including crew dna/memories are always kept so as to allow the whole ship to be rebuilt and its crew regrown.
- What could be worse? The Guardships and crew practically cannot be killed. The amount of resources and planning to destroy even one was absurd and all for naught. Why? Because [[Starbase]] has the memories of the Guardship and its crews.
- So they just replicate that specific Guardship and the crew is cloned. Even when operational, if one of the living soldiers die, they just clone them, with updated memories and techniques.
This keeps squad cohesion and trust between members (something fundamental in the military) always consistent.
