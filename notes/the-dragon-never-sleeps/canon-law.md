# Canon Law

- The Guardships’ allegiance is not to an Emperor or even a government, but to [[Canon law]].  [[Canon law]] is only a few steps up from the law of the jungle, true, but the Guardships enforcing it are ruthless and, owing to a technological advantage that is enforced as part of that law, nearly invincible.  Warships of any kind besides Guardships are illegal in Canon space, so they have a complete monopoly on violence.  When an entity outside Canon space provokes them, they invade, destroy, and annex the offending civilization.
- Now, millennia later, aliens are the majority, with much of the rest made up of [[Artifacts]] that by law aren’t considered human either. 
- The Brobdingnagian Guardships have enforced Canon Law over a realm spanning millions of stars for thirty-seven centuries.
