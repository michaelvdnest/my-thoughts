# Canon Government

- The Guardships’ allegiance is not to an Emperor or even a government, but to [[Canon law]]. 
-  There are some significant differences between Canon and Rome, beginning with the fact that, while the Guardships may seem to be playing the role of the Praetorian Guard, there isn’t an emperor. In fact, we are told little about how [[government]] works (aside from the importance of staying below the Guardship radar). There are bureaucrats, some provinces have presidents, but on the whole, government is not part of the story.
