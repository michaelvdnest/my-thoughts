    - Down Town
      Any Down Town on any inhabited planet is literally a hellhole, infested with all kinds of
      violent crime, deadly plagues and genetic anomalies
      home for all the outcast, the discarded, the ignored, the ordinary, and the abhorred. Princes of lost and vanquished races languished there, hip by thigh with pimps and murderers and worse.

basic structure formed the capital on ten thousand worlds.
    It looked like every outport city on every House-dominated world in Canon. The houses were so damned conservative they would not stray from one standard prefab design. If you wanted something different, you had to hunt up a non-House world.
The High City floated a thousand meters up, connected to UpTown by a flexible tube containing passenger and freight lifts. The proconsuls of the House, the very rich and their hangers-on, remained safely isolated there.
The legs of UpTown lifted it, too, above the perils of a world poorly tamed and, especially, above the taint of the tamers. Administrators and functionaries; Canon garrison if there was one; House dependent, cadet, and allied merchants; contract operators; these lived UpTown.
DownTown was the base of the social pyramid. Its own gradient declined toward the deepest shadow beneath the belly of UpTown.
