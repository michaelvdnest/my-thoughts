- the spidery network that links the far-flung worlds 
- Their task made easier by the use of the universe spanning [[Web]]; an artificial stream between the worlds, left over from some long dead races space engineering.

a mysterious collection of hyperspace threads linking an assortment of star systems and making FTL travel between colony worlds possible. 

The Web is an unexplainable phenomenon - a network of hyperspace "threads" that allows starships to cover thousands of light years in mere hours or days.
