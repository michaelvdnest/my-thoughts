# WarAvocat


And we also have POVs from people that work inside the Guardships. We have the POVs of people who work inside VII Gemina. There's the [[WarAvocat]] (something like the General) and a soldier crew (seen through the eyes of [[Jo Klass]]).

WarAvocat is basically the Guardship's captain, although he has to listen to the Guardship's electronic brain council, refered to as either Deified or Immortals-these are past officers whose minds were recorded onto the Guardship's big tactical brain
