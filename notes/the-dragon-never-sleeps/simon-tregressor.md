# Simon Tregressor

- [[Tregressor]] is already head of one of the most powerful families in the Canon, yet even he must bend his knee to the Guardships. He has spent a long life looking for a way to gain some independence from the Guardships. Old and near death, he is willing to risk all on a single, ambitious roll of the dice that, if successful, will leave House Tregressor with a Guardship of its own. If unsuccessful … well, he’s had a good life.
- Unfortunately for Simon, he lives in a universe where not only do plans not survive their first encounter with the enemy, they don’t even survive encounters with allies or in some cases with the plan’s architect. Simon’s daughter and grandson both have their own agendas (as do their many clones). Tregressor is making common cause with chaotic evil aliens, who may be enemies of the Guardships … but aren’t pro-Simon. Even Simon’s trusted right hand man, the extremely scary [[Lupo Provik]], isn’t 100% on board with the old man’s scheme. 


 - the headquarters of Simon Tregesser (the head of the Tregesser House) are NOT on the Tregesser Prime, but somewhere in outer space.
