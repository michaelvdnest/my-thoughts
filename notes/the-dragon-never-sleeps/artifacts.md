# Artifacts

- Now, millennia later, aliens are the majority, with much of the rest made up of [[Artifacts]] that by law arenâ€™t considered human either. 
- upper classes are expressly denied immortality. A plutocrat can transfer their mind to a new body, but at the cost of trading their old status for that of an artificial person and joining the underclass. 
- Cook gives you [[clones]] of characters who then go clone themselves until who the hell knows - or cares - which one is the original character anymore.
