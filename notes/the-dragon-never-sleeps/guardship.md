# Guardship

- "Surrender or die!" For four thousand years the Guardships had issued that dictat. 
- For four thousand years, the [[Guardships]] ruled [[Canon Space]] with an iron fist.
- Built and armed by great mercantile houses
- their computer cores alive with the engrams of great past leaders,
- Beholden to none, impossible to escape, the invincible warships maintained peace with an iron grip.
- Immortal ships with an immortal crew roaming the galaxy, dealing swiftly and harshly with any mercantile houses or alien races that threatened the status quo.
- huge spaceships with idiosyncratic names that house powerful artificial intelligences. 
- names of Roman legions.
- the Guardships enforcing it are ruthless and, owing to a technological advantage that is enforced as part of that law, nearly invincible.
- When an entity outside Canon space provokes them, they invade, destroy, and annex the offending civilization.
- Even the Guardships themselves prove not to be immune to the passage of time.  
- Each [[Guardship]] has an artificial intelligence at its core managing the automated systems, they are commanded by human crews.  When not needed, humans are stored in suspended animation.  When they are killed, they are recreated from vats using brain scans.  
- One character groups the various Guardships into “Normal”, “Strange”, and “Weird and Deadly”.
-  Guardships have crushed every rebellion against them for almost four thousand years probably s
- Those bad-to-the-bone warships are here; they are called [[Guardships]], and they have been operating for millenniums until the point they are sentient beings who actually learn from their experiences.
- The eternal mission of our [[Guardships]] and their crews is to guard Canon space and respond to any threat to the empire with deadly force. 
- Without ridiculous weaknesses and there are 32 of them.
- So they just replicate that specific Guardship and the crew is cloned. Even when operational, if one of the living soldiers die, they just clone them, with updated memories and techniques.
One of the galaxy Houses wants to capture a Guardship for their own ends. They ally themselves with the [[Outsiders]], a vast empire of methane breather aliens who wants to enter the system/galaxy protected by the Guardships. Oh yes, the [[Guardships]]' crew are only humans.

There are a few names of the Canon’s [[Guardships]]: [[VII Gemina]], [[XII Fulminata]], and [[XXVII Fretensis]]. names of Roman legions.

The [[Guardships]] also have their own identities. For example, [[XII Fulminata]] and its crew are reckless and brutal, shooting first and never asking questions. [[VI Adjutrix]] goes rogue. [[IV Trajana]] seems crazy. [[VII Gemina]] is pretty balanced and fair.

(each has its own "personality," 

[[Guardships]] are immensely powerful starships with immortal fighting crew, ran by powerful [[AI]]s (both in battle and in-between wars during crew's hibernation). These ships are major characters in the story. Automated to the incredible levels they are controlled by AIs and these AIs grow in interaction and under influence of their human crew. As such each and every ship has its own character (wonderful reference to Roman legions, will strike the cord with W40k fans), some succumbing to the anxiety and loneliness that propels them to wander the unknown space and in some cases go completely bananas ending up as schizophrenic miles long mini death-stars following their own agendas. Some even going full AI and not regenerating their human crews.

- [[IX Furia]] Style is to shoot first and ask questions later. Or to shoot first and then shoot the survivors.

- WarCrew - black and silver uniform. 
- OpsCrew - khaki uniform. Below WarCrew in the heirachy of the ship.
- WatchMaster - Part of OpsCrew.

- Hall of Watchers
- Hall of Soldiers

 Hellspinners, guardships' most destructive weapons, along with the more traditional thermonuclear warheads.


Their technology is second only to the Guardships' stuff, and in fact the Guardships have only one hardware advantage, guns called Hellspinners which are considered pretty impressive. (They can be fired through screens, the setting's defensive forcefields. Normally if you want to do that, you have to open a hole. 


They're named after Roman legions, and themselves are essentially legions-crewed by endless clones, replaced over and over again, the Guardship's central Core computer gradually becoming smarter and smarter as it learns from its enemies and adapts. For four thousand years the Guardships-which themselves are backed up by the Guardship starbases so that they can be rebuilt at the drop of a hat (one Guardship that was completely wiped out in a battle returned to full service faster than another that was merely badly damaged, thanks to a completed ship in drydock being imprinted with its backups)-have protected their region of space, and bringing the law to bear even against their own creators, who at this point rather regret what they did and are probably wondering what the heck their ancestors were thinking. The Guardships were each bigger than some gas giant moons (darned big, for reference-these things would give the ol' Death Star the shakes), and even one was usually too much for entire fleets of other craft. It was remarked that the Guardships weren't invincible yet.
