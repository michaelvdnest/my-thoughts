# Houses

- quabbling feudal [[houses]] who rest uneasily beneath the Imperial yoke and endlessly plot to advance themselves.
- upper classes are expressly denied immortality. A plutocrat can transfer their mind to a new body, but at the cost of trading their old status for that of an artificial person and joining the underclass. 
-   [[Canon]] is defended and sometimes expanded by the Guardships, a fleet of gigantic and almost indestructible warships which roam the [[Web]] more or less autonomously, keeping the peace and preventing the various quasi-feudal [[Houses]] of the Canon empire from getting too powerful. Numerous attempts to overthrow the Guardships have been made over several milennia, but none have succeeded.

- each and every [[House]] (as they are called) is more of a incorporated entity with niche (goods, space travel, logistical transport...)
