# Lupo Two


[[Lupo Provik]] works for them and is the brains behind the traps and plans against the Guardships. He also has replication technology like the Guardships and clones himself. He has a girlfriend that is actually a female clone of himself. That's right. The book never states that, it took me awhile to realize Two ([[Lupo Two]], a clone) was a female and while on Lupo's POV they're all business and plans, when the POV switches to other characters and they mention "Lupo and his girlfriend" and it was only after many times that I realized they were actually talking about Lupo Two.
