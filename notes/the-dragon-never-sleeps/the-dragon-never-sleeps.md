# A Dragon Never Sleeps



THE VOICE OF THE DRAGON ECHOED ACROSS CANON SPACE...

"Surrender or die!" For four thousand years the Guardships had issued that dictat. Built and armed by great mercantile houses, their computer cores alive with the engrams of great past leaders, they were feared all along the [[Web]], the spidery network that links the far-flung worlds of [[Canon Space]]. Beholden to none, impossible to escape, the invincible warships maintained peace with an iron grip.

Now a dark [[Presence]] believes it has found a way to wrest the Web from the invincible. The immortal Ku warrior [[Kez Maefele]] knows the ships can be conquered, but he is alone. And as the [[Guardship]] [[VII Gemina]] streaks across the Web to confront the [[Presence]], he must begin his own battle for survival.


For four thousand years, the [[Guardships]] ruled [[Canon Space]] with an iron fist. Immortal ships with an immortal crew roaming the galaxy, dealing swiftly and harshly with any mercantile houses or [[alien]] races that threatened the status quo. But now the [[House Tregesser]] believes they have an edge; a force from outside [[Canon Space]] offers them the resources to throw off [[Guardship]] rule. Their initial gambits precipitate an avalanche of unexpected outcomes, the most unpredicted of which is the emergence of [[Kez Maefele]], one of the few remaining generals of the [[Ku]] Warrior race  the only race to ever seriously threaten Guardship hegemony. [[Kez Maefele]] and a motley group of mysterious aliens, biological constructs, and scheming aristocrats find themselves at the center of the conflict. [[Maefele]] must choose which side he will support; the Guardships, who defeated and destroyed his race, or the unknown forces from [[outside]] Canon Space that promise more death and destruction.








this is a novel of squabbling feudal [[houses]] who rest uneasily beneath the Imperial yoke and endlessly plot to advance themselves.

Thousands of years in the future, humanity has spread across a huge span of the galaxy and no longer has a clear idea of its own origins.  Order in [[[Canon Space]] is kept via huge spaceships with idiosyncratic names that house powerful artificial intelligences.  Although billions of beings both human and alien live peacefully in human space, there are powerful alien species who not only do not share the values that animate [[Canon government]], but actually despise them.  Given this antipathy, war is inevitable, a war that spirals into a clash of civilizations spanning many years and countless star systems.


here are a few names of the Canon’s [[Guardships]]: [[VII Gemina]], [[XII Fulminata]], and [[XXVII Fretensis]]. names of Roman legions.


 The Guardships’ allegiance is not to an Emperor or even a government, but to [[Canon law]].  [[Canon law]] is only a few steps up from the law of the jungle, true, but the Guardships enforcing it are ruthless and, owing to a technological advantage that is enforced as part of that law, nearly invincible.  Warships of any kind besides Guardships are illegal in Canon space, so they have a complete monopoly on violence.  When an entity outside Canon space provokes them, they invade, destroy, and annex the offending civilization.


The system is effectively immortal, but in maintaining itself it necessarily must hold the culture it protects in stasis.  Technological progress has been halted lest anyone acquire Guardship-equivalent technology.  Cities on a hundred planets are constructed from the exact same prefabricated habitats.  Power is concentrated in a quasi-feudal commercial nobility so that the only ones with any power have too much to lose to dare crossing the Guardships.

Slowly the aliens outside Canon space are catching up to the Guardships’ technology levels.  When Canon law was written, humans were the vast majority and so were the only ones with citizenship and the franchise.  Now, millennia later, aliens are the majority, with much of the rest made up of [[Artifacts]] that by law aren’t considered human either.  Even the Guardships themselves prove not to be immune to the passage of time.  Although each [[Guardship]] has an artificial intelligence at its core managing the automated systems, they are commanded by human crews.  When not needed, humans are stored in suspended animation.  When they are killed, they are recreated from vats using brain scans.  This means that even the youngest soldiers were “born” thousands of years ago at the dawn of the Canon era.  Humans who distinguish themselves are “[[Deified]]” through personality uploading and serve as a sort of Senate to advise the two [[Dictats]] (read: Consuls) who command the ship in a manner reminiscent of the Roman Republic.


 Most [[Guardship]] crew characters in the book are from [[VII Gemina]], a ship that initially seems to have weathered the centuries more or less without major changes, but others are…different.  One character groups the various Guardships into “Normal”, “Strange”, and “Weird and Deadly”.


the narrative is focused on [[Kez Maefele]], who (like the protagonist of Consider Phlebas) is a longstanding enemy of the Canon and therefore gives us a detached perspective
 Most of the those opposing the Guardships do so out of a hunger for wealth or power, but he’s different.  Long ago, an alien species called the [[Ku]] fought a long war against the Guardships, and during their war they used increasingly elaborate genetic engineering to improve their soldiers.  [[Maefele]] was the culmination of this program, a strategic genius who led the legendary [[Dire Radiant]], a Ku fleet that refused to surrender with the rest of the species.  Born too late to turn the tide in the war, [[Maefele]] watched first his species’ government but then his rebel fleet ground into dust by the implacable power of the Guardships.  He escaped the final defeat and has been in hiding for uncounted years, for his engineered genes are not programmed to age.

All that time has led him to question the morality of fighting the Guardships in the first place.  He hates the inequality of Canon society, but he knows that if the Guardships were overthrown, Canon space would be at the mercy of outside powers who would be significantly worse.  But when he is recruited by the latest faction hoping to destroy the Guardships, he finds himself agreeing to help.  Like the Mule in Asimov’s Foundation series, he is an individual of such genius he can destroy an otherwise invincible organization, but as someone who was created and not born, he is also a cog in the Ku war machine even a thousand years after their defeat.  Fighting the “dragon” is his purpose in life, something he ultimately can’t turn his back on even if the war will mean the unnecessary deaths of countless innocent people.




The Brobdingnagian Guardships have enforced Canon Law over a realm spanning millions of stars for thirty-seven centuries. They make no pretense of fairness or justice; what Canon stands for is stability and human (within certain limits) supremacy. Aliens and artificial persons who will accept second-class status are permitted to serve their betters. Aliens and artificial persons who object are permitted to die in a holocaust of nuclear fire.

The ancient alien whom everyone called [[Turtle]] appears to be the first, submissive sort of alien. Yet once upon a time, he was the [[Ku]] warrior [[Kez Maefele]], one of the paramount leaders of the [[Dire Radiant]]. The Dire Radiant failed and almost all his companions died. Turtle has been biding his time for centuries, surviving until he thought he had a chance to strike back at the Guardships. Now, thanks to the ambitions of [[Simon Tregressor]], that chance has come.

[[Tregressor]] is already head of one of the most powerful families in the Canon, yet even he must bend his knee to the Guardships. He has spent a long life looking for a way to gain some independence from the Guardships. Old and near death, he is willing to risk all on a single, ambitious roll of the dice that, if successful, will leave House Tregressor with a Guardship of its own. If unsuccessful … well, he’s had a good life.

Unfortunately for Simon, he lives in a universe where not only do plans not survive their first encounter with the enemy, they don’t even survive encounters with allies or in some cases with the plan’s architect. Simon’s daughter and grandson both have their own agendas (as do their many clones). Tregressor is making common cause with chaotic evil aliens, who may be enemies of the Guardships … but aren’t pro-Simon. Even Simon’s trusted right hand man, the extremely scary [[Lupo Provik]], isn’t 100% on board with the old man’s scheme. 

The fact that the Guardships have crushed every rebellion against them for almost four thousand years probably should have convinced Simon not to play silly buggers against them. What Simon cannot predict is that his scheme will inadvertently hand [[Turtle]] the weapons it needs to end the Guardships’ reputation for invincibility. 

What [[Turtle]] cannot know is that his bold stratagem could not possibly come at a worse time. There are things between the stars that are far worse than the Guardships and they have their optical units fixed on Canon space.…

~oOo~

This book is military SF, yes, but it’s also space opera on a grand scale. [[Canon]] includes millions of stars and many species. Human history disappears into fog about six thousand years in the past (still long after humans spread to the stars), but there are hints of alien histories that stretch back billions of years. The Dragon Never Sleeps is set in a universe that reminds me of Norton’s books: humans are just the latest imperial power (having displaced the Go thousands of years ago). Human power won’t last forever. Indeed, much of this book is driven by Canon’s slow realization that humans are now a minority, and the aliens and artificial persons are the majority. Canon’s survival may depend on how effectively they can recruit members of their former underclass into the elite. 


I am also unhappy with the fact that this book’s few female characters tend to be relegated to sex toy status. However, the plot threads re soldiers [[AnyKat]] and [[Jo Klass]] make it clear that the problem is Canon’s social mores, not Cook’s assumptions about gender roles. Canon is a terrible place in many ways; institutionalized sexism is just one of them.

Like many MilSF authors, Cook is inspired by Roman history — though he isn’t just committing dire Turtledoveian cut and paste. There are some significant differences between Canon and Rome, beginning with the fact that, while the Guardships may seem to be playing the role of the Praetorian Guard, there isn’t an emperor. In fact, we are told little about how [[government]] works (aside from the importance of staying below the Guardship radar). There are bureaucrats, some provinces have presidents, but on the whole, government is not part of the story.

Another point of difference is [[Guardship]] [[soldiers]] are functionally immortal; they survive as long as their Guardship does. (Canon seems not to have invented off-site backups). When human soldiers die, they are reborn as clones with transferred memories. Officers who are especially good at their jobs will be preserved as deified artificial intelligences. Experience and skills are not lost due to age and mishaps, The downside is that [[Guardships]] have had time to become a lot stranger than any eccentric human could ever hope to become. 

I find it interesting that Canon’s upper classes are expressly denied immortality. A plutocrat can transfer their mind to a new body, but at the cost of trading their old status for that of an artificial person and joining the underclass. 

Aside from [[Turtle]] and his friends, and perhaps [[Lupo Provik]] once he emerges from Simon’s shadow, this book is a bit lean on sympathetic protagonists. [[Jo Klass]] is competent, but she and her fellow soldiers have turned crimes against humanity into standard operating procedure. They have managed to create an impressively stable empire, one just beginning to show cracks, but stability seems to be its main virtue. For most of the inhabitants, it’s an unpleasant place to live. 

Even though this book about horrible people doing terrible things, I still get caught up in the story every time I read it. Be warned: Cook doesn’t really do linear plots; nobody ever has enough information; and everyone is working at cross purposes. As a result the plot (plots) end up looking less like a Martian canal and more like the Waimakariri:



Those bad-to-the-bone warships are here; they are called [[Guardships]], and they have been operating for millenniums until the point they are sentient beings who actually learn from their experiences.

Cook garrisons these ships with human beings, who never die but are kept in status until needed, and if they perish, their dna and memories are stored in the ship’s database to allow them to be regrown with their abilities intact.

There is even an impregnable [[starbase]], where every ships’ information including crew dna/memories are always kept so as to allow the whole ship to be rebuilt and its crew regrown.

The eternal mission of our [[Guardships]] and their crews is to guard Canon space and respond to any threat to the empire with deadly force. Their task made easier by the use of the universe spanning [[Web]]; an artificial stream between the worlds, left over from some long dead races space engineering.

So, if you upset the [[Guardships]], they will be orbiting your world with overwhelming force before you can do squat to stop them. And even if you destroy a ship or two, it is not going to help you because they just rebuild and regrow themselves. Take that rebel scum!

With all that in mind, some Canon citizens do not love their “protectors” and wish to be rid of them. But it is going to be hard to do that when dealing with immortal ships with god-like power.

Hell, Cook has concocted such an immortal, invulnerable, and omnipotent space armada that even he has a difficult time coming up with a coherent story that actually makes it feasible for someone or something to threaten these Guardships. (The old "Superman is Superman so who can beat him?" problem from back in the day.) And I guess that was what was wrong with The Dragon Never Sleeps to me: no suspense.

I have to give Glen Cook credit here; he tries everything he can to make this story interesting.

You want multiple POV characters; he gives them to you by the dozens. Hell, Cook gives you [[clones]] of characters who then go clone themselves until who the hell knows - or cares - which one is the original character anymore.

You want plot lines; we got so many we lost count. Let us review just a few.

In one [[plot]] line, we get conspiring Commercial Houses trying to rid themselves of their meddling “protectors,” and when one head of a house fails in his plot and dies, we just replace him and rinse and repeat the plot. (And to complicate things, the guy’s clone is still around causing trouble and confusing things.)

In another [[plot]], we get ancient, genetically modified aliens striving to avenge an ancient defeat - or are they? Another plot has us examining the moral ambiguity as to whether it is right for a fleet of human Guardships to be the “overlords” of an interstellar empire which has morphed into a predominantly alien one.

The next has [[Guardships]] losing their “minds” - for a lack of another expression - and exhibiting strange behavior.

One has the immortal crew of the Guardships questioning why they even continue to exist when all they knew is gone.

There is even a galaxy spanning war as disgruntled Canon inhabitants call in the aid of barbaric "[[Outsiders]]" from beyond the empire to smash the status quo.


The scope is vast. The galaxy is ruled by [[Guardships]]. They are Death Stars on steroids. Without ridiculous weaknesses and there are 32 of them.
The crew inside is composed of [[Deified]] (soldiers or officers who are immortalized and become like electronic spirits) and people of flesh and bones who are also, in a way, immortal.

What could be worse? The Guardships and crew practically cannot be killed. The amount of resources and planning to destroy even one was absurd and all for naught. Why? Because [[Starbase]] has the memories of the Guardship and its crews.
So they just replicate that specific Guardship and the crew is cloned. Even when operational, if one of the living soldiers die, they just clone them, with updated memories and techniques.
This keeps squad cohesion and trust between members (something fundamental in the military) always consistent.

But people are not happy with this situation, obviously. But what can anyone do against 32 Death Stars on steroids that don't stay dead for long if you do manage do destroy one of them?

So basically a summary of the [[plot]] is to figure out how to beat the enemy's supposed invincibility and supremacy.
One of the galaxy Houses wants to capture a Guardship for their own ends. They ally themselves with the [[Outsiders]], a vast empire of methane breather aliens who wants to enter the system/galaxy protected by the Guardships. Oh yes, the [[Guardships]]' crew are only humans.

So you have the three top [[House]] leaders, the leader, his daughter and her son conspiring not only against the Guardships but against themselves.

[[Lupo Provik]] works for them and is the brains behind the traps and plans against the Guardships. He also has replication technology like the Guardships and clones himself. He has a girlfriend that is actually a female clone of himself. That's right. The book never states that, it took me awhile to realize Two ([[Lupo Two]], a clone) was a female and while on Lupo's POV they're all business and plans, when the POV switches to other characters and they mention "Lupo and his girlfriend" and it was only after many times that I realized they were actually talking about Lupo Two.

[[Turtle]], or [[Kez Maefele]], is an alien of a long lived species and the one who gave the Guardships the most trouble centuries or millennia ago. He gave up fighting against them, but events will end up changing that.

But he has some moral concerns. Even if he destroys the [[Guardship]] system (which he thinks he can), the [[Outsiders]] (the allies he needs to do that) are actually worse than the Guardships. Can [[Turtle]] do that? On the other hand, maybe he can actually pull something epic like manipulating both sides into thinking he's on their side and make them not destroy, but severely cripple each other so bad so that they both will always have to be wary of each other instead of having clear dominance of everything without any opposition.

And we also have POVs from people that work inside the Guardships. We have the POVs of people who work inside VII Gemina. There's the [[WarAvocat]] (something like the General) and a soldier crew (seen through the eyes of [[Jo Klass]]).
Considering this was written in the 80's the technology guesses were actually excellent. Maintaining [[squad]] cohesion through cloning, "digitalized souls" and orbital fortresses.

The [[Guardships]] also have their own identities. For example, [[XII Fulminata]] and its crew are reckless and brutal, shooting first and never asking questions. [[VI Adjutrix]] goes rogue. [[IV Trajana]] seems crazy. [[VII Gemina]] is pretty balanced and fair.




The basic setting is the sort of thing you might get if Iain Banks were to write stories of a Galactic Patrol-- humanity has established "[[Canon Space]]," a sort of loose interstellar empire arrayed along the [[Web]], a mysterious collection of hyperspace threads linking an assortment of star systems and making FTL travel between colony worlds possible. [[Canon]] is defended and sometimes expanded by the Guardships, a fleet of gigantic and almost indestructible warships which roam the [[Web]] more or less autonomously, keeping the peace and preventing the various quasi-feudal [[Houses]] of the Canon empire from getting too powerful. Numerous attempts to overthrow the Guardships have been made over several milennia, but none have succeeded.

The race to come the closest to beating the guardships was the [[Ku]], a nearly-immortal race of warriors and mystics whose greatest leader, [[Kez Maefele]], fought the Guardships until his supplies ran out, then went into hiding. He's been in hiding for several thousand years when the books open, but events soon force [[Maefele]] back onto the interstellar stage, possibly to renew his ancient battle with the Guardships.

The plot eventually snares [[Maefele]], along with an eclectic mix of mysterious aliens, biological constructs, scheming aristocrats, soldiers and commanders of the Guardship VII Gemina, and several of the Guardships themselves (each has its own "personality," and they behave like somewhat less urbane versions of the Mind-run ships of Banks's Culture novels). Any attempt to summarize the plot would ruin it, but there are enough twists, turns, and blind alleys to keep the reader off-balance to the very end.




Story is about the very isolated human civilization (so called Canon space) divided into myriad of colonized planets and systems linked through the inter dimensional space lanes and left to function on its own as long no power on any of the systems gains the upper hand and affects the balance (status quo). There are rumors of out of Canon civilizations but nobody ventures into these wild-lands. [[Canon]] power structure is reminiscent of feudal system but more appropriate way of describing it would be corporations division - each and every [[House]] (as they are called) is more of a incorporated entity with niche (goods, space travel, logistical transport...) fighting for the supremacy of the Canon space and control of the deadliest force in Canon space (and most probably in entire universe) - Guardships, force with a single function - keeping the balance in Canon space.

When one of the mightiest [[Houses]] decides to execute plan hundreds of years in making to control the Canon [by conspiring with aliens and mysterious non-Canon-space forces] Guardships get automatically activated and what starts as dangerous xenos planet-wide hunt soon escalates into years long conflict that will bring the Canon space to the very brink of extinction.

What I like the most in this story is utter strangeness of this human [[civilization]]. This is the world where immortality is common, use of clones and AI is widespread and mysterious aliens (almost all survivors from civilizations defeated and some even thought annihilated by Guardships at some point in time) roam the streets and spacelanes of human worlds.

[[Guardships]] are immensely powerful starships with immortal fighting crew, ran by powerful [[AI]]s (both in battle and in-between wars during crew's hibernation). These ships are major characters in the story. Automated to the incredible levels they are controlled by AIs and these AIs grow in interaction and under influence of their human crew. As such each and every ship has its own character (wonderful reference to Roman legions, will strike the cord with W40k fans), some succumbing to the anxiety and loneliness that propels them to wander the unknown space and in some cases go completely bananas ending up as schizophrenic miles long mini death-stars following their own agendas. Some even going full AI and not regenerating their human crews.

Through mind upload/download and cloning human crews of the [[Guardships]] that still serve the Canon literally cannot be stopped by death - they learn from mistakes and ultimately turn the tables against every opponent (think "Edge of Tomorrow" do-fail-die-repeat). So when they come back online they are surprised by finding one of the most dangerous [[alien]]s alive. What everyone expects to be a simple police action against the known agitator will soon escalate when it becomes obvious that even greater danger lurks behind the Canon space borders.

This alien, general of the forgotten [[Ku]] civilization, will find himself used by the conspirators and targeted by the Guardships for a same reason - because he almost succeeded in defeating Guardships eons ago. Figuring that Guardships are almost impossible to defeat and that danger from beyond the Canon space is a true one but that conspirators cannot control their allies Ku decides to survive, him and his friends. To achieve this he devises a plan to draw the Guardships into prolonged war of attrition with mysterious menace from outside the Canon space.

Giant ships battling in space, dogfights between nimble interceptors and assaults on imaginable large star bases, AIs going nuts while in isolation and nothing to do for hundreds of years and becoming susceptible to physical seduction, powerful families creating clones with mind copies in them to ensure their life wont be ended prematurely only to have these clones start following their own agendas and aiming for the [[primes]] (originals). Genetically engineered [[soldiers]] waking up to fight yet another war in a world that is always new and different every time they wake up. Schemes within schemes, commando raids and enemy command capturing, mercenaries and crazy religious cults, this book has it all. I especially liked the explanation of the inter-dimensional star-lanes (strands) - it is a truly wonderful depiction of how people see things they dont understand but use in everyday life.
