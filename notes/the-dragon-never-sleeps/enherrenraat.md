# Enherrenraat

Enherrenraat affair - often mentioned by various characters but never quite explained.

some kind of rebellion against them by the very Houses that created them.

It's five hundred years later-many of the Houses are still suffering for it, and the one that warned the Guardships of the insurrection apparently is doing great because it's got exclusive deals with them now

The Enherrenraat was born from a greed-fever dream in Cholot and Merod. Cholot and Merod are paying still.
