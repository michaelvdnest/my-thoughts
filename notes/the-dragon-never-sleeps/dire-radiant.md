# Dire Radiant

- a Ku fleet that refused to surrender with the rest of the species.
- rebel fleet ground into dust by the implacable power of the Guardships.

The ancient alien whom everyone called [[Turtle]] appears to be the first, submissive sort of alien. Yet once upon a time, he was the [[Ku]] warrior [[Kez Maefele]], one of the paramount leaders of the [[Dire Radiant]]. The Dire Radiant failed and almost all his companions died. Turtle has been biding his time for centuries, surviving until he thought he had a chance to strike back at the Guardships. Now, thanks to the ambitions of Simon Tregressor, that chance has come.
