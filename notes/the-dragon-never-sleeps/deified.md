# Deified

- Humans who distinguish themselves are “[[Deified]]” through personality uploading
-  Officers who are especially good at their jobs will be preserved as deified artificial intelligences. 

- [[Kole Marmigus]] - 43 years the master of [[VII Gemina]]. Was [[OpsAvocat]].

WarAvocat is basically the Guardship's captain, although he has to listen to the Guardship's electronic brain council, refered to as either Deified or Immortals-these are past officers whose minds were recorded onto the Guardship's big tactical brain
