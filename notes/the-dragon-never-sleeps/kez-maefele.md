# Kez Maefele

one of the few remaining aliens of an ancient Ku race - the most formidable enemy the Guardships have ever encountered

- The immortal Ku warrior [[Kez Maefele]] knows the ships can be conquered, but he is alone.
- One of the few remaining generals of the [[Ku]] Warrior race  the only race to ever seriously threaten Guardship hegemony. 
- a strategic genius who led the legendary [[Dire Radiant]], a Ku fleet that refused to surrender with the rest of the species.  Born too late to turn the tide in the war, [[Maefele]] watched first his species’ government but then his rebel fleet ground into dust by the implacable power of the Guardships.  He escaped the final defeat and has been in hiding for uncounted years, for his engineered genes are not programmed to age.
- All that time has led him to question the morality of fighting the Guardships in the first place.  He hates the inequality of Canon society, but he knows that if the Guardships were overthrown, Canon space would be at the mercy of outside powers who would be significantly worse.  But when he is recruited by the latest faction hoping to destroy the Guardships, he finds himself agreeing to help.  Like the Mule in Asimov’s Foundation series, he is an individual of such genius he can destroy an otherwise invincible organization, but as someone who was created and not born, he is also a cog in the Ku war machine even a thousand years after their defeat.  Fighting the “dragon” is his purpose in life, something he ultimately can’t turn his back on even if the war will mean the unnecessary deaths of countless innocent people.
- The ancient alien whom everyone called [[Turtle]] appears to be the first, submissive sort of alien. Yet once upon a time, he was the [[Ku]] warrior [[Kez Maefele]], one of the paramount leaders of the [[Dire Radiant]]. The Dire Radiant failed and almost all his companions died. Turtle has been biding his time for centuries, surviving until he thought he had a chance to strike back at the Guardships. Now, thanks to the ambitions of Simon Tregressor, that chance has come.

[[Turtle]], or [[Kez Maefele]], is an alien of a long lived species and the one who gave the Guardships the most trouble centuries or millennia ago. He gave up fighting against them, but events will end up changing that.

But he has some moral concerns. Even if he destroys the [[Guardship]] system (which he thinks he can), the [[Outsiders]] (the allies he needs to do that) are actually worse than the Guardships. Can [[Turtle]] do that? On the other hand, maybe he can actually pull something epic like manipulating both sides into thinking he's on their side and make them not destroy, but severely cripple each other so bad so that they both will always have to be wary of each other instead of having clear dominance of everything without any opposition.

The race to come the closest to beating the guardships was the [[Ku]], a nearly-immortal race of warriors and mystics whose greatest leader, [[Kez Maefele]], fought the Guardships until his supplies ran out, then went into hiding. He's been in hiding for several thousand years when the books open, but events soon force [[Maefele]] back onto the interstellar stage, possibly to renew his ancient battle with the Guardships.

This alien, general of the forgotten [[Ku]] civilization, will find himself used by the conspirators and targeted by the Guardships for a same reason - because he almost succeeded in defeating Guardships eons ago. Figuring that Guardships are almost impossible to defeat and that danger from beyond the Canon space is a true one but that conspirators cannot control their allies Ku decides to survive, him and his friends. To achieve this he devises a plan to draw the Guardships into prolonged war of attrition with mysterious menace from outside the Canon space.

Turtle stood 1.75 meters tall and 1 meter wide. He massed 125 kilos, not a gram of it fat. He had skin the color and texture of a snake's belly. His features vaguely resembled a turtle's. 


And while he was defeated, Kez Maefele survived, hiding with the unassuming alias of Turtle on some random world in the slums. (I'll call him Turtle after this, as he thought of himself as Turtle after all these years.)

Turtle is found by one of the Guardships, and rather impetuously is shown the Guardship starbase. He escapes because the Guardship was a little schizophrenic, and eventually meets up with some aliens who have the power to fight the Guardships toe to toe.
