# Ku

- The only race to ever seriously threaten Guardship hegemony.
- Was defeated and destroyed by the Guardships
- Long ago, an alien species called the [[Ku]] fought a long war against the Guardships, and during their war they used increasingly elaborate genetic engineering to improve their soldiers. 

The race to come the closest to beating the guardships was the [[Ku]], a nearly-immortal race of warriors and mystics whose greatest leader, [[Kez Maefele]], fought the Guardships until his supplies ran out, then went into hiding. He's been in hiding for several thousand years when the books open, but events soon force [[Maefele]] back onto the interstellar stage, possibly to renew his ancient battle with the Guardships.


Probably the single worst of these attacks was launched by the Ku, a now-rare alien race that invaded three thousand years before the book present. Using techniques developed by the legendary warrior-sage Kez Maefele (the Ku are mystics of a sort), the Ku discovered one of the few weaknesses of the Guardships and managed to capture one, although it self destructed before they could do anything with it. As it happens, Kez Maefele is still alive.

The Ku warrior and wizard (I think that means strategist) castes, as well as Kez Maefele, who was a sort of hybrid of the two, were genetically engineered to live forever, as they were extremely useful when they lived a long time
